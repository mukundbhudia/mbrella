### What is this? ###

mbrella is a simple weather web app that gives you basic weather data for a given city. The app uses the [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/) (OWM) API to obtain the data.

**Demo** available here: [https://mbrella.herokuapp.com/](https://mbrella.herokuapp.com/).

### How do I use the demo? ###
* Once you hit the [URL](http://mbrella.herokuapp.com/) you'll land on the app hosted by Heroku.
* You can then search for any city (that OWM provides data for).
* You don't have to sign up to view weather data, but if you do you will be able to save your favourite cities.
* To sign up you can enter any old information as long as you remember at least the email address (which doesn't have to exist for use of the app) and password.
* Once you've signed up you can add your favourate city locations by hitting the apps [settings page](https://mbrella.herokuapp.com/myweather/user).
